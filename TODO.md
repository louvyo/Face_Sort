# TODO List for Face Sorting AI Model Improvements

## Model Performance
- [ ] Experiment with different models in DeepFace (e.g., VGG-Face, Facenet).
- [ ] Implement dynamic threshold adjustment based on user feedback.

## User Experience
- [ ] Add loading indicators during image processing.
- [ ] Improve error handling for uploads and processing.

## Code Structure
- [ ] Refactor the `run_sorting` function into smaller functions.
- [ ] Implement logging for error tracking and performance metrics.

## Image Quality
- [ ] Allow users to set the blur detection threshold.

## Testing and Validation
- [ ] Implement unit tests for critical functions.
- [ ] Create a user feedback mechanism for sorting results.
